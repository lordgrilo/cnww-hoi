A comprehensive, hands-on tutorial series for understanding and applying multivariate information theory to neuroscience and complex systems. This repository provides progressive notebooks that build from foundational concepts to complete analysis pipelines using state-of-the-art Python packages.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This tutorial series takes you from information theory basics to sophisticated analyses of higher-order interactions in neural data:

- **Information theory fundamentals**: Entropy, mutual information, and their multivariate extensions
- **Higher-order interactions**: Synergy, redundancy, and emergent phenomena like the XOR problem
- **Practical tools**: HOI, Frites, and XGI packages for real-world analysis
- **Time-resolved analysis**: Dynamic information flow in neural time series
- **Network representations**: Hypergraphs for higher-order structures
- **Complete pipelines**: End-to-end analysis from raw data to scientific insights

## 📚 Tutorial Structure

The tutorial consists of six progressive Jupyter notebooks, each building on the previous ones:

### [Notebook 1: Information Theory Foundations](01_information_theory_foundations.ipynb)
**Building the Mathematical Groundwork**

Start from scratch with the fundamental concepts of information theory. Learn what entropy really measures, how to compute mutual information, and why these measures matter for understanding dependencies.

**Key Topics:**
- Entropy for discrete and continuous variables
- Joint and conditional entropy
- Mutual information as a measure of dependence
- Conditional mutual information
- Hands-on implementations from first principles

**Prerequisites:** Basic Python, NumPy, and probability theory

---

### [Notebook 2: The XOR Problem - When Intuition Breaks](02_xor_problem_synergy.ipynb)
**Discovering Synergy and Higher-Order Effects**

Experience the mind-bending realization that two variables can each carry zero information individually yet contain perfect information together. This is the gateway to understanding why pairwise analysis is insufficient.

**Key Topics:**
- The XOR function and its information-theoretic properties
- Why Venn diagrams fail for 3+ variables
- Interaction information and its sign
- Synergy vs. redundancy: the fundamental distinction
- "Explaining away" and conditional independence

**Prerequisites:** Notebook 1

---

### [Notebook 3: Higher-Order Interactions with HOI](03_hoi_higher_order_interactions.ipynb)
**Scaling to Professional Analysis Tools**

Transition from manual calculations to the HOI package, designed specifically for computing higher-order information measures on real datasets. Learn to detect synergistic ensembles and decompose information systematically.

**Key Topics:**
- O-information: detecting synergy vs. redundancy
- S-information: measuring total complexity
- Partial Information Decomposition (PID)
- Multiple estimators: Gaussian copula, KNN, binning
- Computational scaling and optimization
- Application to neural population codes

**Prerequisites:** Notebooks 1-2

---

### [Notebook 4: Neural Time Series Analysis with Frites](04_frites_neural_timeseries.ipynb)
**From Static Snapshots to Dynamic Information Flow**

Move beyond static analysis to track how information emerges and flows through neural systems over time. Learn rigorous statistical testing to distinguish real effects from noise.

**Key Topics:**
- Time-resolved mutual information
- Permutation testing for significance
- Cluster-based correction for multiple comparisons
- Dynamic functional connectivity
- Fixed-effect vs. random-effect analysis
- Gaussian Copula MI (GCMI)
- Integration with MNE-Python for M/EEG data

**Prerequisites:** Notebooks 1-3

---

### [Notebook 5: Hypergraph Networks with XGI](05_xgi_hypergraph_networks.ipynb)
**From Information Measures to Network Topology**

Represent higher-order interactions as network structures using hypergraphs. Learn why traditional pairwise networks are insufficient and how hypergraphs naturally capture the structures discovered by information theory.

**Key Topics:**
- Hypergraphs: edges connecting multiple nodes simultaneously
- Creating and manipulating hypergraphs with XGI
- Mapping HOI results to hyperedges
- Hypergraph statistics: degree, clustering, connectivity
- Visualizing higher-order structures
- Temporal hypergraph sequences
- Network topology in neuroscience context

**Prerequisites:** Notebooks 1-4

---

### [Notebook 6: Complete Integration Pipeline](06_complete_integration.ipynb)
**From Raw Data to Scientific Insight**

The synthesis: a complete analysis pipeline integrating HOI, Frites, and XGI to answer a realistic neuroscience question about visual decision-making. This represents a publication-ready workflow you can adapt for your own research.

**Research Question:**
How do hierarchical brain regions (V1 → MT → LIP → PFC) interact synergistically to transform sensory evidence into decisions?

**Analysis Components:**
- When does information flow through the hierarchy? (Frites)
- Which ensembles show synergistic coding? (HOI)
- How is the network organized topologically? (XGI)
- Does synergy emerge early (sensory) or late (decision)?

**Prerequisites:** Notebooks 1-5
